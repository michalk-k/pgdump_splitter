# Motivation
The main reason why this program has been created is to create file structure representing database dump, in order to version such a database in the GIT.

Why not a single file? \
The result has to be versioned (ie in GIT) and then worked on by teams. A single file means merging conflicts. The more files the structure is split into, the fewer merging conflicts. \
Also, working with small files, and comparing their content (ie in GIT) is more comfortable than with a single big one.

# Features
1. Supports SQL dump generated `pg_dump` and `pg_dumpall`
2. Can use dumped file or direct stream through system pipe
3. Dumps each db object to separate file
4. Provides 2 modes of splitting the dumps
5. Allows grouping of related objects into a single file (ie table together with its acls, comments, column comments, defaults etc)
6. Allows to move roles definitions to substructure of each database
7. Files containing functions have filenames shortened to avoid exceeding the maximum file length allowed by the filesystem/os
8. Extracts documentation found in functions code
   
# Usage
`pgdump_splitter {options}`

The following command-line options control the content and format of the output.

`-m`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mode of dumping db objects. origin - files are organized as present in the database dump. custom - reorganizes db objects storing related ones into single file
     
`-f`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;path to dump generated by `pg_dump` or `pg_dumpall`. If omited the program will expect data on stdin via system pipe.

`-dst`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location where structures will be dumped to.

`-ndb`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No db name in destination path. Setting it to true if multiple databases are dumped at once is meaningless.

`-exdb`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular expression pattern allowing to skip extraction of matching databases. Usefull in case of processing dump files. In case of using a pipe from `pg_dumpall`, exclude them using `pd_dumpall` switch

`-mc`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move dump of roles into each database subdirectory. Otherwise they will be found in '{dst}/-/' subdirectory

`-doc`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular expression used to extract docuementation out of function source code into separate .md files. Default is `DOCU(.*)DOCU`


**Examples**

`pgdump_splitter -mode origin -f dbdump.sql -dst /path/to/resulting/structure/`\
or\
`cat dbdump.sql | pgdump_splitter -mode origin -s /path/to/resulting/structure/`

Creates the result from `dbdump.sql` file generated by `pg_dump` or `pg_dumpall` earlier. Result files are organized into file structures proposed by the dump commands.

`pg_dump ... | pgdump_splitter -mode custom -mc -dst /path/to/resulting/structure/`\
or\
`pg_dumpall ... | pgdump_splitter -mode custom -mc -dst /path/to/resulting/structure/`

Creates the result from data streamed directly from `pg_dump` or `pg_dumpall` connected to a given database. Result files are organized in a way, aggregating related objects into single files (ie objects together with their ACLs). Roles definitions, their inheritance and configuration are moved into `{database_name}/-/` subdirectory
