# Motivation
This utility is designed with a specific purpose in mind: to facilitate the creation of a file structure that mirrors a database dump, enabling efficient versioning within a GIT repository.

Why not simply one large file?\
The decision to structure the data across multiple files stems from the necessity to minimize merging conflicts when collaborating across teams. By breaking down the database dump into smaller, more manageable files, the likelihood of encountering excessive merging conflicts is significantly reduced. Additionally, the granularity provided by smaller files enhances the ease of comparing and managing content within GIT, making the collaborative process smoother and more streamlined.

# Features
1. Supports SQL dumps created by `pg_dump` and `pg_dumpall`
2. Can use the dumped file or direct stream through system pipe
3. Dumps each db object to separate file
4. Provides 2 modes of splitting the dumps
5. Allows grouping of related objects into a single file (ie table together with its acls, comments, column comments, defaults etc)
6. Allows to move role definitions to the substructure of each database
7. Files containing functions have filenames shortened to avoid exceeding the maximum file length allowed by the filesystem/os
8. Extracts documentation found in functions code

# Limitations
The program scans dump files line by line executing regular expression matching against them to extract blocks of code. For this reason, using text patterns listed below in a source code of any function may confuse the utility.

`\connect some_string`\
`-- PostgreSQL database dump`\
`-- PostgreSQL database dump complete`\
`-- Name: some_string; Type: some_string; Schema: some_string;`\
`-- Data for Name: some_string; Type: some_string; Schema: some_string;`
   
# Usage
`pgdump_splitter {options} -f {dump_file}`\
or\
`{pg_dump|pg_dumpall} --schema-only ... | pgdump_splitter {options}`

Expected data has to be compliant with the `plain` format of an output generated by pg_drump or pg_dumpall. See the respective tools documentation for details.

Mentioned --schema-only is suggested since pgdump_splitter skips dumped data anyway.


The following command-line options control the `pgdump_splitter` utility:

`-mode`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mode of dumping db objects. origin - files are organized as present in the database dump. custom - reorganizes db objects joining related ones into single file
     
`-f`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;path to dump generated by `pg_dump` or `pg_dumpall`. If omited the program expects data on stdin via system pipe.

`-dst`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location where structures will be dumped to.

`-ndb`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No db name in destination path. Setting it to true for dump containing multiple databases is meaningless.

`-exdb`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular expression pattern allowing to skip extraction of matching databases. Usefull in case of processing dump files. In case of using a pipe from `pg_dumpall`, exclude them using `pd_dumpall` switch

`-mc`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move dump of roles into each database subdirectory. Otherwise they will be found in '{dst}/-/' subdirectory

`-doc`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular expression used to extract docuementation out of function source code into separate .md files. Default is `DOCU(.*)DOCU`

`-buffer`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up maximum buffer size if your dump contains data not fitting the scanner. Default is `1048576`

`-version`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Print the pgdump_spritter version and exit.


**Examples**

`pgdump_splitter -mode origin -f dbdump.sql -dst /path/to/resulting/structure/`\
or\
`cat dbdump.sql | pgdump_splitter -mode origin -s /path/to/resulting/structure/`

Creates the result from `dbdump.sql` file generated by `pg_dump` or `pg_dumpall` earlier. Result files are organized into file structures proposed by the dump commands.

`pg_dump --schema-only ... | pgdump_splitter -mode custom -mc -dst /path/to/resulting/structure/`\
or\
`pg_dumpall --schema-only ... | pgdump_splitter -mode custom -mc -dst /path/to/resulting/structure/`

Creates the result from data streamed directly from `pg_dump` or `pg_dumpall` connected to a given database. Result files are organized in a way, aggregating related objects into single files (ie objects together with their ACLs). Roles definitions, their inheritance and configuration are moved into `{database_name}/-/` subdirectory
